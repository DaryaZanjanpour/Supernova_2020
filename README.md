# Models of SN remnants and magnetic helicity

The code in this repository aims allowing studying *magnetic helicity* from observational data in SNe remnants.

The repository contains a range of simple models for the magnetic field and gas distribution in SN remnants.
It also features any interface code to run these wihtin the 
[IMAGINE](https://github.com/IMAGINE-Consortium/imagine/) pipeline, thus allowing the inference of SN model
properties from observational data. 

Such machinery is used to develop diagnostic tools which can measure current helicity in SN remanants.

# Models of SN remnants and magnetic helicity

*This package is still under development*

The code in this repository aims allowing studying *magnetic helicity* from observational data in SNe remnants.

The repository contains a range of simple models for the magnetic field and gas distribution in SN remnants.
It also (will) contains interface code to run these within the 
[IMAGINE](https://github.com/IMAGINE-Consortium/imagine/) pipeline, thus allowing the inference of SN model
properties from observational data. 

Such machinery is used to develop diagnostic tools which can measure current helicity in SN remnants.

## Requirements and installation 

1. [IMAGINE](https://imagine-code.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) 
2. [numba](https://numba.pydata.org/)
2. [IMAGINE-CRPropa](https://github.com/IMAGINE-Consortium/imagine-crpropa) extension (if using helical random fields)

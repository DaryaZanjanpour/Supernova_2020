# helSN: Magnetic helicity from supernova remnants

The code in this repository aims allowing studying *magnetic helicity* from observational data in SNe remnants.

At the moment, the objective is testing and reorganising the code developed by Ivan Shmarov and converting into an easy to use and extent python tool.

One can check the progress in this, please see the [jupyter notebook](matlab/Test_Shell.ipynb) in the matlab directory.

# Notebooks repository

This directory serves as a repository of our draft personal jupyter notebooks
to facilitate communication. The following convention is suggested:

* notebooks are individual and may be duplicated and renamed if someone wants to
continue a calculation or analysis.
* Filenames follow the convention: `<global_number>-<user>-<description>.ipynb`
* Once things become clear the notebook may be refactored as a script and
  abandoned.
